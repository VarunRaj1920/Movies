I have analysed the top 10,000 popular movies dataset from Kaggle. My goal was to extract meaningful insights from the data and present it in a visually appealing manner. Here's a seggregation of what I obtained:

1. Data Cleaning: I meticulously cleaned the dataset by dropping useless columns, rows with null values, empty genres, empty production company entries, and rows with zero values for runtime, vote average, and vote count. This ensured that my analysis was based on high-quality, relevant data.

2. Calculated Profit: I enriched the dataset by adding a profit column, where I calculated the profit of each movie by subtracting the budget from the revenue. This allowed me to evaluate the financial success of each film.

3. CSV File Export: I saved the cleaned and enriched dataset as a CSV file, making it easily accessible and usable for future analyses.

4. Visualizing Insights: I created visually stunning visualizations to showcase the top 10 movies in various categories:

ðŸ”¸ Top 10 Highest Budget Movies

ðŸ”¸ Top 10 Highest Revenue Movies

ðŸ”¸ Top 10 Most Profitable Movies

ðŸ”¸ Top 10 Most Loss Making Movies

ðŸ”¸ Top 10 Most Popular Movies

ðŸ”¸ Top 10 Highest Vote Count Movies

ðŸ”¸ Top 10 Highest Vote Average Movies

5. Language Analysis: I counted the movies based on the language, providing valuable insights into language preferences among moviegoers.

6. Genre Analysis: For each genre, I listed the 5 most popular and 5most profitable movies, allowing me to identify trends and patterns within each genre.

7. Production Company Insights: I determined the top 5 production companies with the maximum number of movies, highlighting industry leaders and their contributions.

8. Popularity over Time: I visualized the average popularity, vote count, and vote average over time, giving a comprehensive view of the industry's changing trends.

9. Financial Trends: I analyzed the average budget, revenue, and profit over time, uncovering the financial patterns within the film industry.

10. Genre and Language Analysis over Time: I examined the rise and drop of popularity within different genres and languages over time, providing a fascinating perspective on audience preferences.
